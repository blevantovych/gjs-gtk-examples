# gjs-examples
Example of GTK+ and JavaScript using the gjs bindings.

The gjs bindings are used by gnome-shell to provide an interface between the JavaScript language and the GTK+ toolkit. 

The bindings may need to be installed on your distribution:

```
  sudo apt-get install gjs
```

To run the scripts using the bindings, run in a terminal:

```
  gjs <file.js>
```
